Failed to restore configuration to device 192.168.1.9 from I:\02_Job\python\Python_networking\python-scripts\backup-config\1.2-netmiko\R3_2026-02-14.txt: 

Pattern not detected: 'R1.*' in output.

Things you might try to fix this:
1. Adjust the regex pattern to better identify the terminating string. Note, in
many situations the pattern is automatically based on the network device's prompt.
2. Increase the read_timeout to a larger value.

You can also look at the Netmiko session_log or debug log for more information.
